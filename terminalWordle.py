""" Welcome to my Wordle Game via the Python terminal output. In this game, the user gets 6 chances to guess a randomly-generated
5-letter word (aka the Wordle)! For each guess the user makes, the game breaks it down by letter. Specifically, if the 
user guesses a letter in the correct position of the actual word, that letter will become highlighted green. If the user 
guesses a letter that is in the actual word but they have guessed the incorrect position for that letter, the letter 
will be highlighted yellow. Lastly, if the user guesses a word with any letters that are not in the actual word, those 
letters will remain gray. For every letter that the user already guesses, the system adds them to the list of used letters 
and removes them from the list of all letters in order to print the used and unused letters after each guess. """
